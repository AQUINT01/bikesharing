# NYC Citi Bike Sharing
## Project Overview:

Citi Bike is New York City's largest bike sharing system. It’s a convenient solution for trips that are too far to walk but too short for a taxi or the subway. The bike sharing system is combined with all other transportation methods available in the area for commuters.

Using Tableau, we were required  to create a visual presentation to illustrate  Citi's bike sharing  system  in the New York City Area. The purpose of this analysis was to provide investors with good solid business proposal for the city of Des Moines.

## Results:
There are three main observations from this analysis:

### ONE
Citi Bike enjoys a high subscription of membership.


![Customers](https://github.com/AQUINT01/bikesharing/blob/main/images/customers.png)

 81% of the 2,344,224 total bike users were long-term customers.  



### Two
Males use the bike sharing service more frequently.


![gender](https://github.com/AQUINT01/bikesharing/blob/main/images/weekday_trips_gender.png)

As dipicted in the chart by the deep blue-hues, male ridership is strong throughout the week when compared to females.



### Three
Citi Bike experiences an increase usage during peak hours on the weekdays.


![trips](https://github.com/AQUINT01/bikesharing/blob/main/images/weekday_trips.png)

Between 7- 9am (EST), over 10,000 bikes are in use and over 20,000 during  5 - 6pm (EST) during the weekday.  Moreso, Saturday is the best day out of the week with the highest bike count usage throughout the entire day.


![locations](https://github.com/AQUINT01/bikesharing/blob/main/images/locations.png)
Looking deeper into these two maps, it is clear midtown Manhattan has the highest concentration of bike stations for use.  It's no suprise given these are highly densely residential and/or commericalized neighborhoods where other means of public transportation is difficult to navigate to and from.




## Summary:

Bike sharing is ideal for short, one-way rides (getting from point A to point B) due to its open network throughout the city, bikes can be taken out from any station and return at a different location. They can even be used for longer rides.

It can still be very useful even if you own a bike.  It’s ideal for one-way trips, where you don’t have to return home with your own bike. It eliminates the hassle of carrying a bike lock and finding a secure location to lock your bike.  

### Recommendation:

Citi bike has proven to be extremely successful for the City of New York. Many people have opted to share in its vast network as a safe, reliable, and clean form of transportation.  However, given the findings from this analysis, it would help to understand the disparity between male and female users by further studying the dataset.  

Additional visualization to perform:
-   Bar Chart: Market segments grouped by age and gender
-   Density Map:  Most and least active stations used by females.
